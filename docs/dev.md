How to Contribute
=================

Coding Standard
---------------

The code should follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008â€Ž) coding standard.

#### Indentation
This project uses "tabs" for the indentation.


Testing
-------

### All Tests

	make test
	
### Backend Testing

	make testb
	
### Frondend Testing

	make testf
	
The front end unit tests are located along with the module files instead of in unit test own directory. The files are named as MODULE-NAME_test.js. This convention is based on

    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/pub
    
### Test Driven Development

	make tdd
	
This will start a Karma server, which will monitor the js files. If any file is changed, the front end test suite will run. In case something is broken by code change, you will be notified right away.

Dependency Details
------------------

We're testing out using Bower for package management and gulp for build system.

Install the necessary gulp, bower and plugins locally:
	`npm install`

All the dependencies should now be satisfied, we'll now start the build process, which should download all the front-end packages managed by Bower and include them into `index.html`, run:
	`node_modules/.bin/gulp`

Note that we're using the latest version of AngularJS beta (1.3.0), which may have conflicts that require user interaction to resolve. If you get an error about not finding a suitable version Angular, run `bower install` alone, which will let you interactively choose the proper 1.3.0 version. Then run `gulp bowerInstall` and `gulp bowerWiredep` in sequence, which should resolve this.

Partial dependency reference: 
- ng-ckeditor: CKEditor in an Angular directive
- ng-breadcrumbs: Breadcrumb system meant to work with ngRoutes
- angular-http-auth: Watch for http 401 errors reissues pending requests on login
- angular-strap: Bootstrap.js ported from jQuery to Angular

Running the application
-----------------------
Create `config.py` with the proper configurations.

Run the following commands from terminal:

    # install the dependencies
    pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
    # create database tables and populate initial data
    python manage.py database create
    # run the server
    python manage.py runserver

Database
--------
###Initial Setup
To create the tables in the database:

    python manage.py database create

Or drop the existing data and recreate the tables:

    python manage.py database recreate

For the full list commands for the database management:

    python manage.py database

For any updates to the database model SQLAlchemy Alembic scripts are used. ([detailed information](http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/))
###Setting up Alembic
* Setup the environment: `alembic init alembic`
* Set the "sqlalchemy.url" in alembic.ini

###Updating the database schema
* When the application gets updated simply run: `alembic upgrade head`

Conventions
-----------

Each page and route should be in their own modules. The primary Javascript import should be named `<module name>-module.js`. The primary template for the module should be named `<module name>-partial.html`. See `static/modules/example` for an example template that can be used as a base for new modules.

Common code shared across many modules in the application should be abstracted out into it's own module and placed in `static/modules/common`.

Dev Notes
-----------

Breadcrumbs are taken care of by [ng-breadcrumbs](https://github.com/ianwalter/ng-breadcrumbs). 

Loading indicators are automatically shown by [angular-loading-bar](http://chieffancypants.github.io/angular-loading-bar/).

Toasts/flash messages are provided by [AngularJS-Toaster](https://github.com/jirikavi/AngularJS-Toaster). Customized with success(), error(), etc. methods in the `Toaster` provider, so we don't have to always provide all the params in pop().
