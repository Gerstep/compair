                    <p>To understand the usefulness and usability of the ComPAIR learning application, researchers and teaching teams at the University of British Columbia sought (and continue to seek) input from UBC instructors, teaching assistants, and students. The feedback informs ongoing development of the application as well as best practices for encouraging peer feedback and critical thinking on assignments.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center highlight-heading">Key sources of input: <span class="green-text">collaborative internal research</span> // <span class="green-text">interviews & discussions</span> with instructors & TAs // <span class="green-text">surveys & usability testing</span> with students </h3>

                    <h2>General assignment setup</h2>
                    <p>During the pilot at UBC, instructors, teaching assistants, and students participated in surveys, focus groups, and/or one-on-one interviews, and these  revealed common practices that resulted in a more positive learning experience, regardless of discipline. More detail on the pilot evaluation process and its outcomes is available in this <em>Teaching &amp; Learning Inquiry</em> <a href="http://tlijournal.com/tli/index.php/TLI/article/view/156/191" target="_blank">article <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></i></a>.</p>
                    <p>As with any learning activity, how assignments were introduced, designed, and integrated in the course significantly impacted the student experience with ComPAIR.</p>
                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li class="list-group-item">Finding #1: Students who better understood what underlying skill they were practicing in the application felt they learned more from the assignments. It is <strong>key for students to know the end goal</strong> of using ComPAIR&mdash;how it will help their learning&mdash;not only how it works.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Finding #2: Students given more guidance said they learned more from comparing. <strong>Explaining precisely what to look for during comparisons</strong> with multiple descriptive criteria and/or detailed rubrics may result in stronger learning and (possibly) richer feedback.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Finding #3: Regardless of low reported confidence giving peer feedback, many students said they learned simply from practicing this with answer pairs. A <strong>minimum three comparisons per assignment</strong> (the number used in pilot courses) is suggested to give students sufficient practice.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Finding #4: Assignments felt more beneficial to students when presented as part of a larger process. It may be more useful for students to <strong>use ComPAIR in the context of a bigger goal</strong> (e.g., writing a term paper), rather than apply it to standalone assignments.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2><a id="scoring"></a>Scoring and grades</h2>

                    <p>When ComPAIR assignments are set up to select answer pairs adaptively&mdash;that is, to pair answers that are closer in quality over time&mdash;the application tracks a score for each answer. Every answer starts with a base score and that increases or decreases (based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="_blank">Elo rating system <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></i></a>) to reflect the outcome of the comparisons the answer competes in. Basically, after every comparison, the winning answer takes points from the losing one, with the difference between the answer scores at the time of comparison factoring into the total number of points transferred.</p>
                    <p>Once answers move beyond the base score, higher-rated answers are expected to win more often. So if a higher-rated answer wins (as expected), fewer points are taken from the lower-rated answer's score. Conversely, if a lower-rated answer wins in an upset (unexpectedly), more points will be transferred to the lower-rated answer's score. At the end of this process, stronger answers should end up with higher scores and weaker answers with lower scores.</p>
                    <p>Some instructors have used the scores and the ranking they provide to form all or part of a student's grade for the assignments. While anyone is welcome to use the application this way, <strong>we caution against relying on ComPAIR scores for grading without any additional validation</strong>. The algorithm behind the scores has not yet been thoroughly vetted for this purpose and ultimately relies on the skills and training of novice users (students) to provide accurate, well-informed rankings of their peers. Internal research is still developing in this area.</p>
