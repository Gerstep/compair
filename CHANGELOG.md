# v1.0

## Notable changes

* A new location for comparisons, so instructors can view these on the assignment screen alongside answers, help comments, and participation (note: this means existing instructors will notice the absence of the green "See Comparisons" button on the course screen and can access comparisons instead by clicking on the hyperlinked number of comparisons below any assignment)
* Customizable weights for instructors using multiple criteria on an assignment
* The ability for instructors to duplicate assignments
* The option for instructors to customize the instructional text that appears to students prompting the peer feedback portion of the comparison
* Basic notification emails that, when enabled, let instructors know about new help comments and let students know about new replies to their answer
* Automatic embedding of certain multimedia URLS, so links from trusted sources appear in answers without having to be clicked (e.g., YouTube videos)
* Updates to the LTI integration, so ComPAIR can be used at UBC with Canvas
* A new downloadable report for instructors containing student feedback per assignment
* A logo and favicon (bookmark image) for the application
* Improvements to the ComPAIR support site, including the addition of a style guide to keep the application consistent as we grow
